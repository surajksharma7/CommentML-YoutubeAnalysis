# 📑 CommentML – YouTube Sentiment and Trend Analyser

## 1. Introduction

YouTube has become one of the biggest platforms for **content creators and influencers**, serving as a primary channel for audience engagement. Each video attracts hundreds or even thousands of comments, which often contain valuable insights about audience opinions, preferences, and expectations.

However, the sheer volume of comments makes **manual review impractical**.
**CommentML** aims to solve this by leveraging **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically:

* Analyze sentiments in comments,
* Detect trends and recurring themes,
* Summarize feedback for faster decision-making.

This project not only helps influencers optimize their content strategies but also makes audience engagement more **data-driven and efficient**.

## 2. Problem Statement

Content creators face multiple challenges when dealing with large volumes of YouTube comments:

* **High Volume:** Thousands of comments per video, impossible to read manually.
* **Hidden Insights:** Difficulty in identifying audience **sentiment** (positive, neutral, negative).
* **Content Gap:** Missed opportunities to adapt strategies due to lack of structured analysis.

Thus, an **automated comment analysis tool** is essential to efficiently process and interpret large-scale comment data.

---

## 3. Objectives

The primary objectives of CommentML are to:

* Develop a **comment preprocessing pipeline** (cleaning, tokenization, slang/emoji handling, spam filtering).
* Implement **sentiment classification** (positive, neutral, negative).
* Provide **visual insights** (graphs, sentiment distribution, word clouds).
* Summarize trending discussion points from audience feedback.
* Deliver real-time analysis via a **Chrome Extension plugin**.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution (CommentML)

CommentML will be developed in multiple sessions:

1. **Preprocessing & EDA (Session 1)**

   * Load dataset, clean text, explore distributions (comment length, sentiment spread).

2. **Feature Engineering & Model Building**

   * Apply ML/NLP models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Transformer-based models).

3. **Experiment Tracking & Versioning**

   * Use **DVC** and **MLflow** for reproducibility and experiment management.

4. **API Development & Chrome Plugin**

   * Backend (Flask/FastAPI) for serving models.
   * Chrome Extension to provide influencers with real-time insights on YouTube.

5. **Deployment**

   * Containerized via **Docker**.
   * Deployed on **AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch, CodeDeploy)**.

---

## 5. Key Features

* **Sentiment Analysis** – Classify comments into Positive, Neutral, Negative.
* **Trend Tracking** – Track how sentiment evolves across videos/time.
* **Comment Summarization** – Extract top recurring feedback themes.
* **Word Cloud Visualization** – Highlight frequently used words/phrases.
* **Spam & Troll Detection** – Filter irrelevant or harmful content.
* **Data Export** – Export insights in CSV/PDF format for teams.

---

## 6. Technologies

* **Python, Pandas, NumPy** → Data preprocessing & manipulation.
* **NLTK, spaCy** → Text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization.
* **scikit-learn, Optuna, MLflow** → Model training, tuning, tracking.
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn, D3.js** → Data visualization.
* **Flask/FastAPI** → Backend API.
* **Chrome Extension APIs (JS, HTML, CSS)** → Frontend for influencers.
* **AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch, CodeDeploy)** → Cloud deployment.
* **Docker + GitHub Actions** → CI/CD automation.

---

## 7. Challenges

* **Multi-language & slang comments** (e.g., Hinglish, emojis).
* **Spam, bots, and sarcastic comments** that mislead sentiment detection.
* **Class imbalance** between positive, neutral, and negative labels.
* Ensuring **low latency** for near real-time feedback in the Chrome plugin.

---

## 8. Workflow (Planned)

1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing & EDA (**Session 1 – Completed ✅**)
3. Feature Engineering & Model Training
4. Experiment Tracking + DVC Pipeline
5. Model Registry & API Building
6. Chrome Extension Development
7. CI/CD + AWS Deployment

---

## 9. Expected Outcomes

* A deployable **Comment Analysis Tool** that allows influencers to:

  * Understand **audience sentiment** in real-time.
  * Identify **trending topics and key feedback**.
  * Improve **content strategy** with data-backed insights.

* Deliverables:

  * **ML Model + API**
  * **Chrome Extension** for YouTube sentiment & trend analysis
  * **Automated CI/CD pipeline** for smooth deployment
