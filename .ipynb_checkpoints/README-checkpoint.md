# ðŸ“‘ CommentML (Campus Ã— YouTube Sentiment Analysis)

## 1. Introduction

Social media platforms like YouTube are a major hub of audience engagement, especially for **influencers and content creators**. However, with the huge volume of comments, it becomes difficult to manually analyze audience feedback.
**CommentML** is a project designed to bridge this gap by applying **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to automatically analyze, classify, and summarize YouTube (and similar) comments.

## 2. Problem Statement

Influencers and creators face:

* Thousands of comments on each video, making **manual review impractical**.
* Difficulty in understanding **audience sentiment** (positive, negative, neutral).
* Missed opportunities to **improve content strategy** based on feedback.

Thus, there is a need for an automated **Comment Analysis Tool** that can handle large-scale comment streams efficiently.

---

## 3. Objectives

* Build a **comment preprocessing pipeline** (cleaning, tokenization, handling emojis, slang, spam).
* Perform **sentiment analysis** (positive, negative, neutral classification).
* Generate **visual insights** (pie charts, bar graphs, word clouds).
* Provide **automated summarization** of trending topics in comments.
* Integrate into a **Chrome Extension plugin** for real-time use by influencers.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution (CommentML)

The solution consists of:

1. **Preprocessing & EDA (Session 1)**

   * Clean dataset, explore comment length, class distribution, word frequency.
2. **Feature Engineering & Model Building**

   * Use ML/NLP models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Transformers).
3. **Experiment Tracking & Versioning**

   * DVC + MLflow for reproducibility.
4. **API Development & Plugin**

   * Backend using Flask/FastAPI.
   * Chrome Extension for real-time comment insights.
5. **Deployment**

   * Dockerized services deployed on AWS (EC2, S3, CodeDeploy).

---

## 5. Key Features

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Classify comments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
* **Trend Tracking:** Observe sentiment change over time.
* **Comment Summarization:** Highlight key discussion points.
* **Word Cloud Visualization:** Show most frequent words/phrases.
* **Spam & Troll Detection:** Filter irrelevant or harmful content.
* **Data Export:** Export reports in CSV/PDF format.

---

## 6. Technologies

* **Python, Pandas, NumPy** â†’ Data processing.
* **NLTK, spaCy** â†’ NLP tasks.
* **scikit-learn, Optuna, MLflow** â†’ ML modeling and tracking.
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn, D3.js** â†’ Visualization.
* **Flask/FastAPI** â†’ API development.
* **Chrome Extension APIs (JS, HTML, CSS)** â†’ Frontend.
* **AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch, CodeDeploy)** â†’ Deployment.
* **Docker + GitHub Actions (CI/CD)** â†’ Automation.

---

## 7. Challenges

* Multi-language and slang comments.
* Spam, bots, and sarcasm detection.
* Class imbalance in sentiment categories.
* Ensuring real-time latency and smooth user experience.

---

## 8. Workflow (Planned)

1. Data Collection
2. Preprocessing & EDA (Session 1 âœ…)
3. Feature Engineering & Model Training
4. Experiment Tracking + DVC Pipeline
5. Model Registry & API Building
6. Chrome Extension Development
7. CI/CD + Deployment on AWS

---

## 9. Expected Outcomes

* A robust **Comment Analysis Tool** that enables influencers to:

  * Understand **audience sentiment** quickly.
  * Detect trending topics and feedback.
  * Improve **content strategies** with data-driven insights.
* Deployable **Chrome Extension + Backend API** for real-world usage.
